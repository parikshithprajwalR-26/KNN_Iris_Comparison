# KNN From Scratch vs Sklearn (Iris Dataset)

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch and compares it with sklearn's implementation.

Dataset used: Iris Dataset

Steps:
1. Load dataset
2. Split into training and validation
3. Train custom KNN
4. Train sklearn KNN
5. Compare accuracy
6. Using Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation to 

Result:
Both implementations achieve high accuracy on the dataset.

How to Run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
